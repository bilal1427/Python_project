# Surface Temperature Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective / Abstract
This project explores the **Surface Temperature Dataset** to identify key patterns, trends, and relationships. The primary objectives include:

- Understanding variations in surface temperature across different geographic and temporal dimensions.
- Investigating the impact of potential environmental factors on temperature changes.
- Identifying trends that can inform climate policies and environmental strategies.

By analyzing variables such as temperature readings, geographic information, and temporal data, actionable insights are provided to:

- Enhance climate research.
- Improve environmental forecasting models.
- Support decision-making in climate-related policies.

The ultimate goal is to contribute to global climate research and foster sustainable practices.
